This is a modified version of Henry Spencer's regular expression library.
The original library can be found at https://github.com/garyhouston/regex
A description of Spencer's various libraries can be found at
https://garyhouston.github.io/regex/

The changes in this version are:
* The library name has been changed to rxspencer, and the header to
  rxspencer.h, to allow easy installation as a system library on Linux
  without conflicting with other regex libraries.
* A CMake build system, which can build either static or shared libraries,
  maybe even on non-Unix systems.
* A few code modernizations and changes to improve portabilty. 

I (Gary Houston) originally made this version with a build system
based on GNU Automake and Libtool, to allow building a shared library
for a project where the library needed to be dynamically loaded. The
CMake scripts were contributed by Stephen Just, modified from LuaDist
versions.

Spencer's original license can be found in the COPYRIGHT file. The CMake
scripts are licensed under the MIT license. I release all of my own
changes to the public domain under the Creative Commons Zero license.

Installation
============

Ignore the installation notes in the original README below. CMake
needs to be installed. To build from a Linux command line, or
something compatible, within the source directory:

to configure for a static library:
cmake .
or
cmake -Drxshared=0 .

to configure for a shared library:
cmake -Drxshared=1 .

to build:
make
make install

also required on Linux, after installing the shared library:
ldconfig

to run the tests:
make test

to run the tests, with output displayed:
ctest -V

Usage
=====

Include the following headers in a C program:

#include <sys/types.h>
#include <rxspencer/regex.h>

Link with the library using the -lrxspencer flag, as in:
gcc test.c -o test -lrxspencer

The library is further described in the supplied man pages: rxspencer.3
and rxspencer.7.

See WHATSNEW for change listing.

installation notes:
--------
Read the comments at the beginning of Makefile before running.

Utils.h contains some things that just might have to be modified on
some systems, as well as a nested include (ugh) of <assert.h>.

The "fake" directory contains quick-and-dirty fakes for some header
files and routines that old systems may not have.  Note also that
-DUSEBCOPY will make utils.h substitute bcopy() for memmove().

After that, "make r" will build regcomp.o, regexec.o, regfree.o,
and regerror.o (the actual routines), bundle them together into a test
program, and run regression tests on them.  No output is good output.

"make lib" builds just the .o files for the actual routines (when
you're happy with testing and have adjusted CFLAGS for production),
and puts them together into libregex.a.  You can pick up either the
library or *.o ("make lib" makes sure there are no other .o files left
around to confuse things).

Main.c, debug.c, split.c are used for regression testing but are not part
of the RE routines themselves.

Regex.h goes in /usr/include.  All other .h files are internal only.
